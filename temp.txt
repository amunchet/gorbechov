Earnings were significantly under pressure in H1 2019 due to a one-time drag in the Critical Materials division, caused by a sharp drop in vanadium prices. However, this created an interesting buying opportunity with 233% upside. The market&rsquo;s intense attention to the Critical Materials division is unjustified, as most growth is expected from the Technologies division. Its peers get a very rich EV/EBITDA valuation. If we apply this to AMG Technologies, it would be worth $20.50 today, which is very close to the total stock price (for just that one segment). The most interesting part from this (thesis) is the expected spin-off for AMG Technologies, which will create a lot of shareholder value and will put a strong support around this $20.50 mark. Consequently, if you would buy AMG, the risk-reward will be very interesting.</p>\n<figure><img data-height=\"20\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-width=\"550\" src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/9/19/saupload_Alpha_only_1.png\"></img></figure>\n<p><b>Seeking Alpha:</b> Have you observed other situations (other companies) where steep price volatility of a key input caused a grave short-term profitability issue, like with AMG's recent issue with vanadium? If so, how did investors react? Do you find that investors tend to overlook these sort of short-term margin dislocations?</p>\n<p><strong>Robbe Delaet:</strong> In my opinion, the biggest gains can be made by searching for market overreactions caused by a short term margin decline which you can&rsquo;t extrapolate to the future. Sadly, I can&rsquo;t think of an example caused by price volatility as of now. However, I wrote an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4292214-capri-holdings-steep-decline-unjustified\">article on 09/17/19 about Capri Holdings</a> (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPRI\">CPRI</a>), where intense investments in their new brand (Versace) put pressure on margins. Consequently, the stock price dropped almost 60%. If you have a strong explanation on why margins will improve later on, these stock declines create significant buying opportunities. That&rsquo;s why I bought AMG myself and why I am planning on buying Capri Holdings in the future.</p>\n<figure><img data-height=\"20\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-width=\"550\" src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/9/19/saupload_Alpha_only_2.png\"></img></figure>\n<p><b>Seeking Alpha:</b> Is there anything that AMG can do to mitigate the negative impact this kind of vanadium volatility has on operating profitability, if it should happen again?</p>\n<p><strong>Robbe Delaet:</strong> For many raw materials, companies can cover big price volatility via contracts. This is something you would expect AMG to do as well, because the vanadium business can have a significant impact on their total earnings. If I do remember well, a question is made about this on the last annual general meeting.

If you think about it, it is unbelievable. <br>\nAMG wouldn't have had this strong decline in earnings if this price surge and price decline had happened slower (let&rsquo;s say in 3 years). In fact, low vanadium prices are not a problem for AMG.

They did a 10% buyback, they opened the lithium mine, they announced the second recycling facility &lsquo;Cambridge 2&rsquo;, they announced the Technologies spin-off, and they announced a new long-term EBITDA target of $350 mln etc. In my opinion, the market is being unreasonable at this moment. I bought more shares myself as I expect much upside.</p>\n<figure><img data-height=\"20\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-width=\"550\" src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/9/19/saupload_Alpha_only.png\"></img></figure>\n<p>Thanks to Robbe Delaet for the interview.
