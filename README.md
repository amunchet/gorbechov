# Gorbechov Project
This is my Seeking Alpha Editor Picks prediction grading system.  It's named Gorbechov off the Soviet leader's famous joke about not knowing which economic advisor was intelligent.  A more detailed writeup is available at my blog: http://www.chetenright.com/blog


## Phases
Initial: I initially scraped past articles, using Feedly and some in-browser Chrome JS.  I put the results there.  If successful, I was planning to monitor the RSS feed directly.

Phase 1-4:  Various phases of the process, sepearated for sanity. 

#### Final thoughts and the Jupyter notebook are found in Phase 4

## Notes
The .txt raw files come from Feedly's archives - basically just infinite scrolling back to retrieve the links.

Going forward, we might just crawl the RSS and store ourselves.  It'll take 90 days to evaluate though.
