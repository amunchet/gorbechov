## Summary
This is phase 2.  

The primary issue here will be:
---
- Evaluating whether or not the article recommends a buy.  Discard if it does not.
- From there, evaluating the performance of the recommended stock over the next 90 days
	+ This will be the yahoo_historical module

Seems that most of the articles have the words "are long" or "am long" followed by the symbol name.
- Great use of disclosures!
